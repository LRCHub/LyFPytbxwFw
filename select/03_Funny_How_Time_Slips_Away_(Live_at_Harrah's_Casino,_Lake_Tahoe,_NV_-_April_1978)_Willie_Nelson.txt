Well, hello there
My, it's been a long, long time
How am I doing?
Oh, I guess I'm doing fine
Well it's been so long now
But it seems now, that it was only yesterday
Gee, ain't it funny, how time just slips away

How's your new love?
I hope he's doing fine
And I heard you told him
That you'd love him 'til the end of time
Now, that's the same thing that you told me
And it seems like only yesterday
Gee, ain't it funny, how time just slips away

I gotta go now
And I guess I'll see you around
Don't know when though
'Cause I never know, when I'll be back in town
But remember, what I tell you
That in time you're gonna pay
And it's surprising, how time just slips away.
