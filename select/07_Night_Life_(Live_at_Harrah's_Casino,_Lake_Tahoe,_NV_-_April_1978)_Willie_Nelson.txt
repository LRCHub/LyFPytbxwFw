When the evenin' sun goes down
You gonna find me hangin' 'round
Oh, the night life, it ain't no good life
But it's my life

Many people just like me
Dreamin' of old used-to-be's
Oh, the night life, it ain't no good life
But it's my life

Listen to the blues that they're playin'
Listen what the blues are sayin'

Life is just another scene
From the world of broken dreams
Oh, the night life, it ain't no good life
But it's my life

Listen to the blues that they're playin'
Listen what the blues are sayin'

Life is just another scene
From the world of broken dreams
Oh, the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life.
